This is the SBA database of US Federal PPP loans recipients
=============================================================


It's a simple conversion from the SBA-supplied CSV into sqlite3 format. It contains all loans above $150k where the company is identified by name. 

Also included a sample python script to query the database

The full database with all 50 states and territories with all loans below $150k can be obtained by the owner of this repository. Contact me by email

The current database version is as of July 7th, 2020, as delivered by the SBA.
